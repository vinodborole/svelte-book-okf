# Lifecycle hooks

In Svelte 5, the component lifecycle consists of only two parts: Its creation and its destruction. Everything in-between — when certain state is updated — is not related to the component as a whole; only the parts that need to react to the state change are notified. This is because under the hood the smallest unit of change is actually not a component, it’s the (render) effects that the component sets up upon component initialization. Consequently, there’s no such thing as a “before update”/"after update” hook.

## onMount

The `onMount` function schedules a callback to run as soon as the component has been mounted to the DOM. It must be called during the component’s initialisation (but doesn’t need to live *inside* the component; it can be called from an external module).

`onMount` does not run inside a component that is rendered on the server.

```
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	onMount(() => {
		console.log('the component has mounted');
	});
</script>
```
If a function is returned from `onMount`, it will be called when the component is unmounted.

```
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	onMount(() => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			console.log('beep');
		}, 1000);
		return () => clearInterval(interval);
	});
</script>
```
 This behaviour will only work when the function passed to `onMount` is *synchronous*. `async` functions always return a `Promise`.

## onDestroy

Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted.

Out of `onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` and `onDestroy`, this is the only one that runs inside a server-side component.

```
<script>
	import { onDestroy } from 'svelte';
	onDestroy(() => {
		console.log('the component is being destroyed');
	});
</script>
```
## tick

While there’s no “after update” hook, you can use `tick` to ensure that the UI is updated before continuing. `tick` returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied, or in the next microtask if there are none.

```
<script>
	import { tick } from 'svelte';
	$effect.pre(() => {
		console.log('the component is about to update');
		tick().then(() => {
				console.log('the component just updated');
		});
	});
</script>
```
## Deprecated: beforeUpdate / afterUpdate

Svelte 4 contained hooks that ran before and after the component as a whole was updated. For backwards compatibility, these hooks were shimmed in Svelte 5 but not available inside components that use runes.

```
<script>
	import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate } from 'svelte';
	beforeUpdate(() => {
		console.log('the component is about to update');
	});
	afterUpdate(() => {
		console.log('the component just updated');
	});
</script>
```
Instead of `beforeUpdate` use `$effect.pre` and instead of `afterUpdate` use `$effect` instead — these runes offer more granular control and only react to the changes you’re actually interested in.

### Chat window example

To implement a chat window that autoscrolls to the bottom when new messages appear (but only if you were *already* scrolled to the bottom), we need to measure the DOM before we update it.

In Svelte 4, we do this with `beforeUpdate`, but this is a flawed approach — it fires before *every* update, whether it’s relevant or not. In the example below, we need to introduce checks like `updatingMessages` to make sure we don’t mess with the scroll position when someone toggles dark mode.

With runes, we can use `$effect.pre`, which behaves the same as `$effect` but runs before DOM updates scheduled after it (see [$effect.pre]($effect#$effect.pre) for the exact ordering). As long as we explicitly reference `messages` inside the effect body, it will run whenever `messages` changes, but *not* when `theme` changes.

`beforeUpdate`, and its equally troublesome counterpart `afterUpdate`, are therefore deprecated in Svelte 5.

```
<script>
	import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate, tick } from 'svelte';
	let updatingMessages = false;
	let theme = $state('dark');
	let messages = $state([]);
	let viewport;
	beforeUpdate(() => {
	$effect.pre(() => {
		if (!updatingMessages) return;
		messages;
		const autoscroll = viewport && viewport.offsetHeight + viewport.scrollTop > viewport.scrollHeight - 50;
		if (autoscroll) {
			tick().then(() => {
				viewport.scrollTo(0, viewport.scrollHeight);
			});
		}
		updatingMessages = false;
	});
	function handleKeydown(event) {
		if (event.key === 'Enter') {
			const text = event.target.value;
			if (!text) return;
			updatingMessages = true;
			messages = [...messages, text];
			event.target.value = '';
		}
	}
	function toggle() {
		theme = theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';
	}
</script>
<div class:dark={theme === 'dark'}>
	<div bind:this={viewport}>
		{#each messages as message}
			<p>{message}</p>
		{/each}
	</div>
	<input onkeydown={handleKeydown} />
	<button onclick={toggle}> Toggle dark mode </button>
</div>
```
