# Best practices

This document outlines some best practices that will help you write fast, robust Svelte apps. It is also available as a `svelte-core-bestpractices` skill for your agents.

## $state

Only use the `$state` rune for variables that should be *reactive* — in other words, variables that cause an `$effect`, `$derived` or template expression to update. Everything else can be a normal variable.

Objects and arrays (`$state({...})` or `$state([...])`) are made deeply reactive, meaning mutation will trigger updates. This has a trade-off: in exchange for fine-grained reactivity, the objects must be proxied, which has performance overhead. In cases where you're dealing with large objects that are only ever reassigned (rather than mutated), use `$state.raw` instead. This is often the case with API responses, for example.

## $derived

To compute something from state, use `$derived` rather than `$effect`:

```
// do this
let square = 
```
```
function $derived<number>(expression: number): number
namespace $derived
```

Declares derived state, i.e. one that depends on other state variables.
The expression inside `$derived(...)` should be free of side-effects.

Example:

`let double = $derived(count * 2);`

$derived(`let num: number`num * `let num: number`num);
// don't do this
let square;
```
function $effect(fn: () => void | (() => void)): void
namespace $effect
```

Runs code when a component is mounted to the DOM, and then whenever its dependencies change, i.e. `$state` or `$derived` values.
The timing of the execution is after the DOM has been updated.

Example:

`$effect(() => console.log('The count is now ' + count));`

If you return a function from the effect, it will be called right before the effect is run again, or when the component is unmounted.

Does not run during server-side rendering.

$effect(() => {
	`let square: number`square = `let num: number`num * `let num: number`num;
});
 `$derived` is given an expression, *not* a function. If you need to use a function (because the expression is complex, for example) use `$derived.by`.

Deriveds are writable — you can assign to them, just like `$state`, except that they will re-evaluate when their expression changes.

If the derived expression is an object or array, it will be returned as-is — it is *not* made deeply reactive. You can, however, use `$state` inside `$derived.by` in the rare cases that you need this.

## $effect

Effects are an escape hatch and should mostly be avoided. In particular, avoid updating state inside effects.

- If you need to sync state to an external library such as D3, it is often neater to use [`{@attach ...}`](@attach)
- If you need to run some code in response to user interaction, put the code directly in an event handler or use a [function binding](bind#Function-bindings) as appropriate
- If you need to log values for debugging purposes, use [`$inspect`]($inspect)
- If you need to observe something external to Svelte, use [`createSubscriber`](svelte-reactivity#createSubscriber)

Never wrap the contents of an effect in `if (browser) {...}` or similar — effects do not run on the server.

## $props

Treat props as though they will change. For example, values that depend on props should usually use `$derived`:

`let {` `let type: any`type } = ```
function $props(): any
namespace $props
```

Declares the props that a component accepts. Example:

`let { optionalProp = 42, requiredProp, bindableProp = $bindable() }: { optionalProp?: number; requiredProps: string; bindableProp: boolean } = $props();`

$props();
// do this
let color = ```
function $derived<"red" | "green">(expression: "red" | "green"): "red" | "green"
namespace $derived
```

Declares derived state, i.e. one that depends on other state variables.
The expression inside `$derived(...)` should be free of side-effects.

Example:

`let double = $derived(count * 2);`

$derived(`let type: any`type === 'danger' ? 'red' : 'green');
// don't do this — `color` will not update if `type` changes
let color = `let type: any`type === 'danger' ? 'red' : 'green';
## $inspect.trace

`$inspect.trace` is a debugging tool for reactivity. If something is not updating properly or running more than it should you can add `$inspect.trace(label)` as the first line of an `$effect` or `$derived.by` (or any function they call) to trace their dependencies and discover which one triggered an update.

## Events

Any element attribute starting with `on` is treated as an event listener:

```
<button onclick={() => {...}}>click me</button>
<!-- attribute shorthand also works -->
<button {onclick}>...</button>
<!-- so do spread attributes -->
<button {...props}>...</button>
```
If you need to attach listeners to `window` or `document` you can use `<svelte:window>` and `<svelte:document>`:

```
<svelte:window onkeydown={...} />
<svelte:document onvisibilitychange={...} />
```
Avoid using `onMount` or `$effect` for this.

## Snippets

[Snippets](snippet) are a way to define reusable chunks of markup that can be instantiated with the [`{@render ...}`](@render) tag, or passed to components as props. They must be declared within the template.

```
{#snippet greeting(name)}
  <p>hello {name}!</p>
{/snippet}
{@render greeting('world')}
```
 Snippets declared at the top level of a component (i.e. not inside elements or blocks) can be referenced inside `<script>`. A snippet that doesn't reference component state is also available in a `<script module>`, in which case it can be exported for use by other components.

## Each blocks

Prefer to use [keyed each blocks](each#Keyed-each-blocks) — this improves performance by allowing Svelte to surgically insert or remove items rather than updating the DOM belonging to existing items.

 The key *must* uniquely identify the object. Do not use the index as a key.

Avoid destructuring if you need to mutate the item (with something like `bind:value={item.count}`, for example).

## Using JavaScript variables in CSS

If you have a JS variable that you want to use inside CSS you can set a CSS custom property with the `style:` directive.

`<div style:--columns={columns}>...</div>`
You can then reference `var(--columns)` inside the component's `<style>`.

## Styling child components

The CSS in a component's `<style>` is scoped to that component. If a parent component needs to control the child's styles, the preferred way is to use CSS custom properties:

```
<!-- Parent.svelte -->
<Child --color="red" />
<!-- Child.svelte -->
<h1>Hello</h1>
<style>
	h1 {
		color: var(--color);
	}
</style>
```
If this is impossible (for example, the child component comes from a library) you can use `:global` to override styles:

```
<div>
	<Child />
</div>
<style>
	div :global {
		h1 {
			color: red;
		}
	}
</style>
```
## Context

Consider using context instead of declaring state in a shared module. This will scope the state to the part of the app that needs it, and eliminate the possibility of it leaking between users when server-side rendering.

Use `createContext` rather than `setContext` and `getContext`, as it provides type safety.

## Async Svelte

If using version 5.36 or higher, you can use [await expressions](await-expressions) and [hydratable](hydratable) to use promises directly inside components. Note that these require the `experimental.async` option to be enabled in `svelte.config.js` as they are not yet considered fully stable.

## Avoid legacy features

Always use runes mode for new code, and avoid features that have more modern replacements:

- use `$state` instead of implicit reactivity (e.g.`let count = 0; count += 1` )
- use `$derived` and`$effect` instead of`$:` assignments and statements (but only use effects when there is no better solution)
- use `$props` instead of`export let` ,`$$props` and`$$restProps`
- use `onclick={...}` instead of`on:click={...}`
- use `{#snippet ...}` and`{@render ...}` instead of`<slot>` and`$$slots` and`<svelte:fragment>`
- use `<DynamicComponent>` instead of`<svelte:component this={DynamicComponent}>`
- use `import Self from './ThisComponent.svelte'` and`<Self>` instead of`<svelte:self>`
- use classes with `$state` fields to share reactivity between components, instead of using stores
- use `{@attach ...}` instead of`use:action`
- use clsx-style arrays and objects in `class` attributes, instead of the`class:` directive
