# svelte

```
import {
	
```
`class SvelteComponent<Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>, Events extends Record<string, any> = any, Slots extends Record<string, any> = any>`This was the base class for Svelte components in Svelte 4. Svelte 5+ components
are completely different under the hood. For typing, use `Component` instead.
To instantiate components, use `mount` instead.
See [migration guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Components-are-no-longer-classes) for more info.

SvelteComponent,
	`class SvelteComponentTyped<Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>, Events extends Record<string, any> = any, Slots extends Record<string, any> = any>`SvelteComponentTyped,
	`function afterUpdate(fn: () => void): void`Schedules a callback to run immediately after the component has been updated.

The first time the callback runs will be after the initial `onMount`.

In runes mode use `$effect` instead.

afterUpdate,
	`function beforeUpdate(fn: () => void): void`Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is updated after any state change.

The first time the callback runs will be before the initial `onMount`.

In runes mode use `$effect.pre` instead.

beforeUpdate,
	`function createContext<T>(): [() => T, (context: T) => T]`Returns a `[get, set]` pair of functions for working with context in a type-safe way.

`get` will throw an error if no parent component called `set`.

createContext,
	`function createEventDispatcher<EventMap extends Record<string, any> = any>(): EventDispatcher<EventMap>`Creates an event dispatcher that can be used to dispatch [component events](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/legacy-on#Component-events).
Event dispatchers are functions that can take two arguments: `name` and `detail`.

Component events created with `createEventDispatcher` create a
[CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent).
These events do not [bubble](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Event_bubbling_and_capture).
The `detail` argument corresponds to the [CustomEvent.detail](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail)
property and can contain any type of data.

The event dispatcher can be typed to narrow the allowed event names and the type of the `detail` argument:

`const ``const dispatch: any`dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{
 `loaded: null`loaded: null; // does not take a detail argument
 `change: string`change: string; // takes a detail argument of type string, which is required
 `optional: number | null`optional: number | null; // takes an optional detail argument of type number
}>();

createEventDispatcher,
	```
function createRawSnippet<Params extends unknown[]>(fn: (...params: Getters<Params>) => {
    render: () => string;
    setup?: (element: Element) => void | (() => void);
}): Snippet<Params>
```

Create a snippet programmatically

createRawSnippet,
	`function flushSync<T = void>(fn?: (() => T) | undefined): T`Synchronously flush any pending updates.
Returns void if no callback is provided, otherwise returns the result of calling the callback.

flushSync,
	`function fork(fn: () => void): Fork`Creates a 'fork', in which state changes are evaluated but not applied to the DOM.
This is useful for speculatively loading data (for example) when you suspect that
the user is about to take some action.

Frameworks like SvelteKit can use this to preload data when the user touches or
hovers over a link, making any subsequent navigation feel instantaneous.

The `fn` parameter is a synchronous function that modifies some state. The
state changes will be reverted after the fork is initialised, then reapplied
if and when the fork is eventually committed.

When it becomes clear that a fork will *not* be committed (e.g. because the
user navigated elsewhere), it must be discarded to avoid leaking memory.

fork,
	`function getAbortSignal(): AbortSignal`Returns an `AbortSignal`[derived](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$derived) or [effect](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect) re-runs or is destroyed.

Must be called while a derived or effect is running.

```
<script>
	import { getAbortSignal } from 'svelte';
	let { id } = $props();
	async function getData(id) {
		const response = await fetch(`/items/${id}`, {
			signal: getAbortSignal()
		});
		return await response.json();
	}
	const data = $derived(await getData(id));
</script>
```

getAbortSignal,
	`function getAllContexts<T extends Map<any, any> = Map<any, any>>(): T`Retrieves the whole context map that belongs to the closest parent component.
Must be called during component initialisation. Useful, for example, if you
programmatically create a component and want to pass the existing context to it.

getAllContexts,
	`function getContext<T>(key: any): T`Retrieves the context that belongs to the closest parent component with the specified `key`.
Must be called during component initialisation.

`createContext`

getContext,
	`function hasContext(key: any): boolean`Checks whether a given `key` has been set in the context of a parent component.
Must be called during component initialisation.

hasContext,
	`function hydratable<T>(key: string, fn: () => T): T`hydratable,
	```
function hydrate<Props extends Record<string, any>, Exports extends Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>> | Component<Props, Exports, any>, options: {} extends Props ? {
    target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
    props?: Props;
    events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    intro?: boolean;
    recover?: boolean;
    transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown;
} : {
    target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
    props: Props;
    events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    intro?: boolean;
    recover?: boolean;
    transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown;
}): Exports
```

Hydrates a component on the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component

hydrate,
	`function mount<Props extends Record<string, any>, Exports extends Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>> | Component<Props, Exports, any>, options: MountOptions<Props>): Exports`Mounts a component to the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component.
Transitions will play during the initial render unless the `intro` option is set to `false`.

mount,
	`function onDestroy(fn: () => any): void`Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted.

Out of `onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` and `onDestroy`, this is the
only one that runs inside a server-side component.

onDestroy,
	`function onMount<T>(fn: () => NotFunction<T> | Promise<NotFunction<T>> | (() => any)): void``onMount`, like `$effect``$effect`, the provided function only runs once.

It must be called during the component's initialisation (but doesn't need to live *inside* the component;
it can be called from an external module). If a function is returned *synchronously* from `onMount`,
it will be called when the component is unmounted.

`onMount` functions do not run during [server-side rendering](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-server#render).

onMount,
	`function setContext<T>(key: any, context: T): T`Associates an arbitrary `context` object with the current component and the specified `key`
and returns that object. The context is then available to children of the component
(including slotted content) with `getContext`.

Like lifecycle functions, this must be called during component initialisation.

`createContext`

setContext,
	`function settled(): Promise<void>`Returns a promise that resolves once any state changes, and asynchronous work resulting from them,
have resolved and the DOM has been updated

settled,
	`function tick(): Promise<void>`Returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied.

tick,
	```
function unmount(component: Record<string, any>, options?: {
    outro?: boolean;
} | undefined): Promise<void>
```

Unmounts a component that was previously mounted using `mount` or `hydrate`.

Since 5.13.0, if `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise (prior to 5.13.0, returns `void`).

```
import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';
const app = mount(App, { target: document.body });
// later...
unmount(app, { outro: true });
```

```
## afterUpdate

Use

[instead](/docs/svelte/$effect)`$effect`

Schedules a callback to run immediately after the component has been updated.

The first time the callback runs will be after the initial `onMount`.

In runes mode use `$effect` instead.

`function afterUpdate(fn: () => void): void;`## beforeUpdate

Use

[instead](/docs/svelte/$effect#$effect.pre)`$effect.pre`

Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is updated after any state change.

The first time the callback runs will be before the initial `onMount`.

In runes mode use `$effect.pre` instead.

`function beforeUpdate(fn: () => void): void;`## createContext

Available since 5.40.0

Returns a `[get, set]` pair of functions for working with context in a type-safe way.

`get` will throw an error if no parent component called `set`.

`function createContext<T>(): [() => T, (context: T) => T];`## createEventDispatcher

Use callback props and/or the

`$host()`rune instead — see[migration guide](/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Event-changes-Component-events)

Creates an event dispatcher that can be used to dispatch [component events](/docs/svelte/legacy-on#Component-events).
Event dispatchers are functions that can take two arguments: `name` and `detail`.

Component events created with `createEventDispatcher` create a
[CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent).
These events do not [bubble](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Event_bubbling_and_capture).
The `detail` argument corresponds to the [CustomEvent.detail](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail)
property and can contain any type of data.

The event dispatcher can be typed to narrow the allowed event names and the type of the `detail` argument:

`const ``const dispatch: any`dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{
 `loaded: null`loaded: null; // does not take a detail argument
 `change: string`change: string; // takes a detail argument of type string, which is required
 `optional: number | null`optional: number | null; // takes an optional detail argument of type number
}>();```
function createEventDispatcher<
	EventMap extends Record<string, any> = any
>(): EventDispatcher<EventMap>;
```
## createRawSnippet

Create a snippet programmatically

```
function createRawSnippet<Params extends unknown[]>(
	fn: (...params: Getters<Params>) => {
		render: () => string;
		setup?: (element: Element) => void | (() => void);
	}
): Snippet<Params>;
```
## flushSync

Synchronously flush any pending updates. Returns void if no callback is provided, otherwise returns the result of calling the callback.

`function flushSync<T = void>(fn?: (() => T) | undefined): T;`## fork

Available since 5.42

Creates a 'fork', in which state changes are evaluated but not applied to the DOM. This is useful for speculatively loading data (for example) when you suspect that the user is about to take some action.

Frameworks like SvelteKit can use this to preload data when the user touches or hovers over a link, making any subsequent navigation feel instantaneous.

The `fn` parameter is a synchronous function that modifies some state. The
state changes will be reverted after the fork is initialised, then reapplied
if and when the fork is eventually committed.

When it becomes clear that a fork will *not* be committed (e.g. because the
user navigated elsewhere), it must be discarded to avoid leaking memory.

`function fork(fn: () => void): Fork;`## getAbortSignal

Returns an [ AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that aborts when the current 

[derived](/docs/svelte/$derived)or

[effect](/docs/svelte/$effect)re-runs or is destroyed.

Must be called while a derived or effect is running.

```
<script>
	import { getAbortSignal } from 'svelte';
	let { id } = $props();
	async function getData(id) {
		const response = await fetch(`/items/${id}`, {
			signal: getAbortSignal()
		});
		return await response.json();
	}
	const data = $derived(await getData(id));
</script>
```
`function getAbortSignal(): AbortSignal;`## getAllContexts

Retrieves the whole context map that belongs to the closest parent component. Must be called during component initialisation. Useful, for example, if you programmatically create a component and want to pass the existing context to it.

```
function getAllContexts<
	T extends Map<any, any> = Map<any, any>
>(): T;
```
## getContext

Retrieves the context that belongs to the closest parent component with the specified `key`.
Must be called during component initialisation.

[ createContext](/docs/svelte/svelte#createContext) is a type-safe alternative.

`function getContext<T>(key: any): T;`## hasContext

Checks whether a given `key` has been set in the context of a parent component.
Must be called during component initialisation.

`function hasContext(key: any): boolean;`## hydratable

`function hydratable<T>(key: string, fn: () => T): T;`## hydrate

Hydrates a component on the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component

```
function hydrate<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>
>(
	component:
		| ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>>
		| Component<Props, Exports, any>,
	options: {} extends Props
		? {
				target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
				props?: Props;
				events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
				context?: Map<any, any>;
				intro?: boolean;
				recover?: boolean;
				transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown;
			}
		: {
				target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
				props: Props;
				events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
				context?: Map<any, any>;
				intro?: boolean;
				recover?: boolean;
				transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown;
			}
): Exports;
```
## mount

Mounts a component to the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component.
Transitions will play during the initial render unless the `intro` option is set to `false`.

```
function mount<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>
>(
	component:
		| ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>>
		| Component<Props, Exports, any>,
	options: MountOptions<Props>
): Exports;
```
## onDestroy

Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted.

Out of `onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` and `onDestroy`, this is the
only one that runs inside a server-side component.

`function onDestroy(fn: () => any): void;`## onMount

`onMount`, like [ $effect](/docs/svelte/$effect), schedules a function to run as soon as the component has been mounted to the DOM.
Unlike 

`$effect`, the provided function only runs once.It must be called during the component's initialisation (but doesn't need to live *inside* the component;
it can be called from an external module). If a function is returned *synchronously* from `onMount`,
it will be called when the component is unmounted.

`onMount` functions do not run during [server-side rendering](/docs/svelte/svelte-server#render).

```
function onMount<T>(
	fn: () =>
		| NotFunction<T>
		| Promise<NotFunction<T>>
		| (() => any)
): void;
```
## setContext

Associates an arbitrary `context` object with the current component and the specified `key`
and returns that object. The context is then available to children of the component
(including slotted content) with `getContext`.

Like lifecycle functions, this must be called during component initialisation.

[ createContext](/docs/svelte/svelte#createContext) is a type-safe alternative.

`function setContext<T>(key: any, context: T): T;`## settled

Available since 5.36

Returns a promise that resolves once any state changes, and asynchronous work resulting from them, have resolved and the DOM has been updated

`function settled(): Promise<void>;`## tick

Returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied.

`function tick(): Promise<void>;`## unmount

Unmounts a component that was previously mounted using `mount` or `hydrate`.

Since 5.13.0, if `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](/docs/svelte/transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise (prior to 5.13.0, returns `void`).

`import { ``function mount<Props extends Record<string, any>, Exports extends Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>> | Component<Props, Exports, any>, options: MountOptions<Props>): Exports`Mounts a component to the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component.
Transitions will play during the initial render unless the `intro` option is set to `false`.

mount, ```
function unmount(component: Record<string, any>, options?: {
    outro?: boolean;
} | undefined): Promise<void>
```

Unmounts a component that was previously mounted using `mount` or `hydrate`.

Since 5.13.0, if `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise (prior to 5.13.0, returns `void`).

```
import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

```

```
mount<Record<string, any>, {
    $on?(type: string, callback: (e: any) => void): () => void;
    $set?(props: Partial<Record<string, any>>): void;
} & Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>> | Component<Record<string, any>, {

    $set?(props: Partial<Record<string, any>>): void;
} & Record<string, any>, any>, options: MountOptions<...>): {
    $on?(type: string, callback: (e: any) => void): () => void;
    $set?(props: Partial<Record<string, any>>): void;
} & Record<...>
```

Mounts a component to the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with `accessors: true`) of the component.
Transitions will play during the initial render unless the `intro` option is set to `false`.

mount(`const App: LegacyComponentType`App, { `target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot`Target element where the component will be mounted.

target: `var document: Document``window.document`

document.`Document.body: HTMLElement`The `Document.body``null` if no such element exists.

body });
// later...
```
function unmount(component: Record<string, any>, options?: {
    outro?: boolean;
} | undefined): Promise<void>
```

Unmounts a component that was previously mounted using `mount` or `hydrate`.

Since 5.13.0, if `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise (prior to 5.13.0, returns `void`).

```
import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';
const app = mount(App, { target: document.body });
// later...
unmount(app, { outro: true });
```

unmount(```
const app: {
    $on?(type: string, callback: (e: any) => void): () => void;
    $set?(props: Partial<Record<string, any>>): void;
} & Record<string, any>
```

`outro?: boolean | undefined`outro: true });```
function unmount(
	component: Record<string, any>,
	options?:
		| {
				outro?: boolean;
		  }
		| undefined
): Promise<void>;
```
## untrack

When used inside a [ $derived](/docs/svelte/$derived) or 

[, any state read inside](/docs/svelte/$effect)

`$effect``fn` will not be treated as a dependency.```
function $effect(fn: () => void | (() => void)): void
namespace $effect
```

Runs code when a component is mounted to the DOM, and then whenever its dependencies change, i.e. `$state` or `$derived` values.
The timing of the execution is after the DOM has been updated.

Example:

`$effect(() => console.log('The count is now ' + count));`

If you return a function from the effect, it will be called right before the effect is run again, or when the component is unmounted.

Does not run during server-side rendering.

$effect(() => {
	// this will run when `data` changes, but not when `time` changes
	save(data, {
		`timestamp: any`timestamp: untrack(() => time)
	});
});`function untrack<T>(fn: () => T): T;`## Component

Can be used to create strongly typed Svelte components.

#### Example:

You have component library on npm called `component-library`, from which
you export a component called `MyComponent`. For Svelte+TypeScript users,
you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:

```
import type { Component } from 'svelte';
export declare const MyComponent: Component<{ foo: string }> {}
```
Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file with TypeScript:

```
<script lang="ts">
	import { MyComponent } from "component-library";
</script>
<MyComponent foo={'bar'} />
```
```
interface Component<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = {},
	Exports extends Record<string, any> = {},
	Bindings extends keyof Props | '' = string
> {…}
```
```

	this: void,
	internals: ComponentInternals,
	props: Props

- `internal`An internal object used by Svelte. Do not use or modify.
- `props`The props passed to the component.

`element?: typeof HTMLElement;`The custom element version of the component. Only present if compiled with the `customElement` compiler option

## ComponentConstructorOptions

In Svelte 4, components are classes. In Svelte 5, they are functions. Use

`mount`instead to instantiate components. See[migration guide](/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Components-are-no-longer-classes)for more info.

```
interface ComponentConstructorOptions<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>
> {…}
```
`target: Element | Document | ShadowRoot;``anchor?: Element;``props?: Props;``context?: Map<any, any>;``hydrate?: boolean;``intro?: boolean;``recover?: boolean;``sync?: boolean;``idPrefix?: string;``$$inline?: boolean;``transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown;`## ComponentEvents

The new

`Component`type does not have a dedicated Events type. Use`ComponentProps`instead.

```
type ComponentEvents<Comp extends SvelteComponent> =
	Comp extends SvelteComponent<any, infer Events>
		? Events
		: never;
```
## ComponentInternals

Internal implementation details that vary between environments

`type ComponentInternals = Branded<{}, 'ComponentInternals'>;`## ComponentProps

Convenience type to get the props the given component expects.

Example: Ensure a variable contains the props expected by `MyComponent`:

`import type { ``type ComponentProps<Comp extends SvelteComponent | Component<any, any>> = Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, any> ? Props : Comp extends Component<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, string> ? Props : never`Convenience type to get the props the given component expects.

Example: Ensure a variable contains the props expected by `MyComponent`:

```
import type { ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
// Errors if these aren't the correct props expected by MyComponent.
const props: ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent> = { foo: 'bar' };
```

 In Svelte 4, you would do `ComponentProps<MyComponent>` because `MyComponent` was a class.

Example: A generic function that accepts some component and infers the type of its props:

```
import type { Component, ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
function withProps<TComponent extends Component<any>>(
	component: TComponent,
	props: ComponentProps<TComponent>
) {};
// Errors if the second argument is not the correct props expected by the component in the first argument.
withProps(MyComponent, { foo: 'bar' });
```

ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import ```
type MyComponent = SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>
const MyComponent: LegacyComponentType
```

`const props: Record<string, any>`props: `type ComponentProps<Comp extends SvelteComponent | Component<any, any>> = Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, any> ? Props : Comp extends Component<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, string> ? Props : never`Convenience type to get the props the given component expects.

Example: Ensure a variable contains the props expected by `MyComponent`:

```
import type { ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
// Errors if these aren't the correct props expected by MyComponent.
const props: ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent> = { foo: 'bar' };
```

 In Svelte 4, you would do `ComponentProps<MyComponent>` because `MyComponent` was a class.

Example: A generic function that accepts some component and infers the type of its props:

```
import type { Component, ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
function withProps<TComponent extends Component<any>>(
	component: TComponent,
	props: ComponentProps<TComponent>
) {};
// Errors if the second argument is not the correct props expected by the component in the first argument.
withProps(MyComponent, { foo: 'bar' });
```

ComponentProps<typeof `const MyComponent: LegacyComponentType`MyComponent> = { `foo: string`foo: 'bar' };In Svelte 4, you would do

`ComponentProps<MyComponent>`because`MyComponent`was a class.

Example: A generic function that accepts some component and infers the type of its props:

`import type { ``interface Component<Props extends Record<string, any> = {}, Exports extends Record<string, any> = {}, Bindings extends keyof Props | "" = string>`Can be used to create strongly typed Svelte components.

#### Example:

You have component library on npm called `component-library`, from which
you export a component called `MyComponent`. For Svelte+TypeScript users,
you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:

```
import type { Component } from 'svelte';
export declare const MyComponent: Component<{ foo: string }> {}
```

Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension
to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file
with TypeScript:

```
<script lang="ts">
	import { MyComponent } from "component-library";
</script>
<MyComponent foo={'bar'} />
```

Component, `type ComponentProps<Comp extends SvelteComponent | Component<any, any>> = Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, any> ? Props : Comp extends Component<infer Props extends Record<string, any>, any, string> ? Props : never`Convenience type to get the props the given component expects.

Example: Ensure a variable contains the props expected by `MyComponent`:

```
import type { ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
// Errors if these aren't the correct props expected by MyComponent.
const props: ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent> = { foo: 'bar' };

		? Props
		: Comp extends Component<infer Props, any>
			? Props
			: never;
```
## ComponentType

This type is obsolete when working with the new

`Component`type.

```
type ComponentType<
	Comp extends SvelteComponent = SvelteComponent
> = (new (
	options: ComponentConstructorOptions<
		Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props>
			? Props
			: Record<string, any>
	>
) => Comp) & {
	/** The custom element version of the component. Only present if compiled with the `customElement` compiler option */
	element?: typeof HTMLElement;
};
```
## EventDispatcher

```
interface EventDispatcher<
	EventMap extends Record<string, any>
> {…}
```
```
<Type extends keyof EventMap>(
	...args: null extends EventMap[Type]
		? [type: Type, parameter?: EventMap[Type] | null | undefined, options?: DispatchOptions]
		: undefined extends EventMap[Type]
			? [type: Type, parameter?: EventMap[Type] | null | undefined, options?: DispatchOptions]
			: [type: Type, parameter: EventMap[Type], options?: DispatchOptions]
): boolean;
```
## Fork

Available since 5.42

Represents work that is happening off-screen, such as data being preloaded in anticipation of the user navigating

`interface Fork {…}``commit(): Promise<void>;`Commit the fork. The promise will resolve once the state change has been applied

`discard(): void;`Discard the fork

## MountOptions

Defines the options accepted by the `mount()` function.

```
type MountOptions<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>
> = {
	/**
	 * Target element where the component will be mounted.
	 */
	target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
	/**
	 * Optional node inside `target`. When specified, it is used to render the component immediately before it.
	 */
	anchor?: Node;
	/**
	 * Allows the specification of events.
	 * @deprecated Use callback props instead.
	 */
	events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
	/**
	 * Can be accessed via `getContext()` at the component level.
	 */
	context?: Map<any, any>;
	/**
	 * Whether or not to play transitions on initial render.
	 * @default true
	 */
	intro?: boolean;
	/**
	 * A function that transforms errors caught by error boundaries before they are passed to the `failed` snippet.
	 * Defaults to the identity function.
	 */
	transformError?: (
		error: unknown
	) => unknown | Promise<unknown>;
} & ({} extends Props
	? {
			/**
			 * Component properties.
			 */
			props?: Props;
		}
	: {
			/**
			 * Component properties.
			 */
			props: Props;
		});
```
## Snippet

The type of a `#snippet` block. You can use it to (for example) express that your component expects a snippet of a certain type:

`let { ````
let banner: Snippet<[{
    text: string;
}]>
```

```
banner: Snippet<[{
    text: string;
}]>
```

`type Snippet = /*unresolved*/ any`Snippet<[{ `text: string`text: string }]> } = ```
function $props(): any
namespace $props
```

Declares the props that a component accepts. Example:

`let { optionalProp = 42, requiredProp, bindableProp = $bindable() }: { optionalProp?: number; requiredProps: string; bindableProp: boolean } = $props();`

$props();You can only call a snippet through the `{@render ...}` tag.

See the [snippet documentation](/docs/svelte/snippet) for more info.

`interface Snippet<Parameters extends unknown[] = []> {…}````
(
	this: void,
	// this conditional allows tuples but not arrays. Arrays would indicate a
	// rest parameter type, which is not supported. If rest parameters are added
	// in the future, the condition can be removed.
	...args: number extends Parameters['length'] ? never : Parameters
): {
	'{@render ...} must be called with a Snippet': "import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'";
} & typeof SnippetReturn;
```
