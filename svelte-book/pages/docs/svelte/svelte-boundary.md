# <svelte:boundary>

`<svelte:boundary onerror={handler}>...</svelte:boundary>`This feature was added in 5.3.0

Boundaries allow you to 'wall off' parts of your app, so that you can:

- provide UI that should be shown when `await`expressions are first resolving
- handle errors that occur during rendering or while running effects, and provide UI that should be rendered when an error happens

If a boundary handles an error (with a `failed` snippet or `onerror` handler, or both) its existing content will be removed.

Errors occurring outside the rendering process (for example, in event handlers or after a

`setTimeout`or async work) arenotcaught by error boundaries.

## Properties

For the boundary to do anything, one or more of the following must be provided.

### pending

This snippet will be shown when the boundary is first created, and will remain visible until all the `await` expressions inside the boundary have resolved (demo):

```
<svelte:boundary>
	<p>{await delayed('hello!')}</p>
	{#snippet pending()}
		<p>loading...</p>
	{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
```
The `pending` snippet will *not* be shown for subsequent async updates — for these, you can use `$effect.pending()`.

In the playground, your app is rendered inside a boundary with an empty pending snippet, so that you can use

`await`without having to create one.

### failed

If a `failed` snippet is provided, it will be rendered when an error is thrown inside the boundary, with the `error` and a `reset` function that recreates the contents (demo):

```
<svelte:boundary>
	<FlakyComponent />
	{#snippet failed(error, reset)}
		<button onclick={reset}>oops! try again</button>
	{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
```
As with snippets passed to components, the

`failed`snippet can be passed explicitly as a property...`<svelte:boundary {failed}>...</svelte:boundary>`...or implicitly by declaring it directly inside the boundary, as in the example above.

### onerror

If an `onerror` function is provided, it will be called with the same two `error` and `reset` arguments. This is useful for tracking the error with an error reporting service...

```
<svelte:boundary onerror={(e) => report(e)}>
	...
</svelte:boundary>
```
...or using `error` and `reset` outside the boundary itself:

```
<script>
	let error = $state(null);
	let reset = $state(() => {});
	function onerror(e, r) {
		error = e;
		reset = r;
	}
</script>
<svelte:boundary {onerror}>
	<FlakyComponent />
</svelte:boundary>
{#if error}
	<button onclick={() => {
		error = null;
		reset();
	}}>
		oops! try again
	</button>
{/if}
```
If an error occurs inside the `onerror` function (or if you rethrow the error), it will be handled by a parent boundary if such exists.

## Using transformError

By default, error boundaries have no effect on the server — if an error occurs during rendering, the render as a whole will fail.

Since 5.51 you can control this behaviour for boundaries with a `failed` snippet, by calling `render(...)` with a `transformError` function.

If you're using Svelte via a framework such as SvelteKit, you most likely don't have direct access to the

`render(...)`call — the framework must configure`transformError`on your behalf. SvelteKit will add support for this in the near future, via the`handleError`hook.

The `transformError` function must return a JSON-stringifiable object which will be used to render the `failed` snippet. This object will be serialized and used to hydrate the snippet in the browser:

`import { ````
function render<Comp extends SvelteComponent<any> | Component<any>, Props extends ComponentProps<Comp> = ComponentProps<Comp>>(...args: {} extends Props ? [component: Comp extends SvelteComponent<any> ? ComponentType<Comp> : Comp, options?: {
    props?: Omit<Props, "$$slots" | "$$events">;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    idPrefix?: string;
    csp?: Csp;
    transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>;
}] : [component: Comp extends SvelteComponent<any> ? ComponentType<Comp> : Comp, options: {
    props: Omit<Props, "$$slots" | "$$events">;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    idPrefix?: string;
    csp?: Csp;
    transformError?: (error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>;
}]): RenderOutput
```

Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option.
Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app.

render } from 'svelte/server';
import ```
type App = SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>
const App: LegacyComponentType
```

`const head: string`HTML that goes into the `<head>`

head, `const body: string`HTML that goes somewhere into the `<body>`

body } = await ```
render<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>, Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>>, options?: {
    props?: Omit<Record<string, any>, "$$slots" | "$$events"> | undefined;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    idPrefix?: string;
    csp?: Csp;
    transformError?: ((error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>) | undefined;
} | undefined): RenderOutput
```

Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option.
Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app.

render(`const App: LegacyComponentType`App, {
	`transformError?: ((error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>) | undefined`transformError: (`error: unknown`error) => {
		// log the original error, with the stack trace...
		`var console: Console`The `console` module provides a simple debugging console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by web browsers.

The module exports two specific components:

- A `Console`class with methods such as`console.log()`,`console.error()`and`console.warn()`that can be used to write to any Node.js stream.
- A global `console`instance configured to write to`process.stdout`and`process.stderr`. The global`console`can be used without importing the`node:console`module.

**Warning**`note on process I/O` for
more information.

Example using the global `console`:

```
console.log('hello world');
// Prints: hello world, to stdout
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// Prints: hello world, to stdout
console.error(new Error('Whoops, something bad happened'));
// Prints error message and stack trace to stderr:
//   Error: Whoops, something bad happened
//     at [eval]:5:15
//     at Script.runInThisContext (node:vm:132:18)
//     at Object.runInThisContext (node:vm:309:38)
//     at node:internal/process/execution:77:19
//     at [eval]-wrapper:6:22
//     at evalScript (node:internal/process/execution:76:60)
//     at node:internal/main/eval_string:23:3
const name = 'Will Robinson';
console.warn(`Danger ${name}! Danger!`);
// Prints: Danger Will Robinson! Danger!, to stderr
```

Example using the `Console` class:

```
const out = getStreamSomehow();
const err = getStreamSomehow();
const myConsole = new console.Console(out, err);
myConsole.log('hello world');
// Prints: hello world, to out
myConsole.log('hello %s', 'world');
// Prints: hello world, to out
myConsole.error(new Error('Whoops, something bad happened'));
// Prints: [Error: Whoops, something bad happened], to err
const name = 'Will Robinson';
myConsole.warn(`Danger ${name}! Danger!`);
// Prints: Danger Will Robinson! Danger!, to err
```

console.`Console.error(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void (+1 overload)`Prints to `stderr` with newline. Multiple arguments can be passed, with the
first used as the primary message and all additional used as substitution
values similar to `printf(3)`
(the arguments are all passed to `util.format()`).

```
const code = 5;
console.error('error #%d', code);
// Prints: error #5, to stderr
console.error('error', code);
// Prints: error 5, to stderr
```

If formatting elements (e.g. `%d`) are not found in the first string then
`util.inspect()` is called on each argument and the
resulting string values are concatenated. See `util.format()`
for more information.

error(`error: unknown`error);
		// ...and return a sanitized user-friendly error
		// to display in the `failed` snippet
		return {
			`message: string`message: 'An error occurred!'
		};
	};
});If `transformError` throws (or rethrows) an error, `render(...)` as a whole will fail with that error.

Errors that occur during server-side rendering can contain sensitive information in the

`message`and`stack`. It's recommended to redact these rather than sending them unaltered to the browser.

If the boundary has an `onerror` handler, it will be called upon hydration with the deserialized error object.

The `mount` and `hydrate` functions also accept a `transformError` option, which defaults to the identity function. As with `render`, this function transforms a render-time error before it is passed to a `failed` snippet or `onerror` handler.
