# Hydratable data

In Svelte, when you want to render asynchronous content data on the server, you can simply `await` it. This is great! However, it comes with a pitfall: when hydrating that content on the client, Svelte has to redo the asynchronous work, which blocks hydration for however long it takes:

```
<script>
  import { getUser } from 'my-database-library';
  // This will get the user on the server, render the user's name into the h1,
  // and then, during hydration on the client, it will get the user _again_,
  // blocking hydration until it's done.
  const user = await getUser();
</script>
<h1>{user.name}</h1>
```
That's silly, though. If we've already done the hard work of getting the data on the server, we don't want to get it again during hydration on the client. `hydratable` is a low-level API built to solve this problem. You probably won't need this very often — it will be used behind the scenes by whatever datafetching library you use. For example, it powers [remote functions in SvelteKit](/docs/kit/remote-functions).

To fix the example above:

```
<script>
  import { hydratable } from 'svelte';
  import { getUser } from 'my-database-library';
  // During server rendering, this will serialize and stash the result of `getUser`, associating
  // it with the provided key and baking it into the `head` content. During hydration, it will
  // look for the serialized version, returning it instead of running `getUser`. After hydration
  // is done, if it's called again, it'll simply invoke `getUser`.
  const user = await hydratable('user', () => getUser());
</script>
<h1>{user.name}</h1>
```
This API can also be used to provide access to random or time-based values that are stable between server rendering and hydration. For example, to get a random number that doesn't update on hydration:

`import { ``function hydratable<T>(key: string, fn: () => T): T`hydratable } from 'svelte';
const `const rand: number`rand = `hydratable<number>(key: string, fn: () => number): number`hydratable('random', () => `var Math: Math`An intrinsic object that provides basic mathematics functionality and constants.

Math.`Math.random(): number`Returns a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.

random());If you're a library author, be sure to prefix the keys of your `hydratable` values with the name of your library so that your keys don't conflict with other libraries.

## Serialization

All data returned from a `hydratable` function must be serializable. But this doesn't mean you're limited to JSON — Svelte uses [ devalue](https://npmjs.com/package/devalue), which can serialize all sorts of things including 

`Map`, `Set`, `URL`, and `BigInt`. Check the documentation page for a full list. In addition to these, thanks to some Svelte magic, you can also fearlessly use promises:```
<script>
  import { hydratable } from 'svelte';
  const promises = hydratable('random', () => {
	return {
	  one: Promise.resolve(1),
	  two: Promise.resolve(2)
	}
  });
</script>
{await promises.one}
{await promises.two}
```
## CSP

`hydratable` adds an inline `<script>` block to the `head` returned from `render`. If you're using [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) (CSP), this script will likely fail to run. You can provide a `nonce` to `render`:

`const ``const nonce: `${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}``nonce = `var crypto: Crypto`crypto.`Crypto.randomUUID(): `${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}``The `randomUUID()`

randomUUID();
const { `const head: string`HTML that goes into the `<head>`

head, `const body: string`HTML that goes somewhere into the `<body>`

body } = await ```
render<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>, Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>>, options?: {
    props?: Omit<Record<string, any>, "$$slots" | "$$events"> | undefined;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    idPrefix?: string;
    csp?: Csp;
    transformError?: ((error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>) | undefined;
} | undefined): RenderOutput
```

Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option.
Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app.

render(`const App: LegacyComponentType`App, {
	`csp?: Csp | undefined`csp: { `nonce?: string | undefined`nonce }
});This will add the `nonce` to the script block, on the assumption that you will later add the same nonce to the CSP header of the document that contains it:

`let response: Response`response.`Response.headers: Headers`The `headers`

headers.`Headers.set(name: string, value: string): void`The `set()``Headers` object, or adds the header if it does not already exist.

set(
  'Content-Security-Policy',
  `script-src 'nonce-${`let nonce: string`nonce}'`
 );It's essential that a `nonce` — which, British slang definition aside, means 'number used once' — is only used when dynamically server rendering an individual response.

If instead you are generating static HTML ahead of time, you must use hashes instead:

`const { ``const head: string`HTML that goes into the `<head>`

head, `const body: string`HTML that goes somewhere into the `<body>`

body, ```
const hashes: {
    script: `sha256-${string}`[];
}
```

```
render<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>, Record<string, any>>(component: ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Record<string, any>, any, any>>, options?: {
    props?: Omit<Record<string, any>, "$$slots" | "$$events"> | undefined;
    context?: Map<any, any>;
    idPrefix?: string;
    csp?: Csp;
    transformError?: ((error: unknown) => unknown | Promise<unknown>) | undefined;
} | undefined): RenderOutput
```

Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option.
Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app.

render(`const App: LegacyComponentType`App, {
	`csp?: Csp | undefined`csp: { `hash?: boolean | undefined`hash: true }
});`hashes.script` will be an array of strings like `["sha256-abcd123"]`. As with `nonce`, the hashes should be used in your CSP header:

`let response: Response`response.`Response.headers: Headers`The `headers`

headers.`Headers.set(name: string, value: string): void`The `set()``Headers` object, or adds the header if it does not already exist.

set(
  'Content-Security-Policy',
  `script-src ${```
let hashes: {
    script: string[];
}
```

`script: string[]`script.`Array<string>.map<string>(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => string, thisArg?: any): string[]`Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.

map((`hash: string`hash) => `'${`hash: string`hash}'`).`Array<string>.join(separator?: string): string`Adds all the elements of an array into a string, separated by the specified separator string.

join(' ')}`
 );We recommend using `nonce` over hash if you can, as `hash` will interfere with streaming SSR in the future.
